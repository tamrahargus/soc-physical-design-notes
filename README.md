# SoC Physical Design Interview Prep

This repo is part of my prep for upcoming Physical Design Engineering (PDE) interviews—especially focused on SoC-level layout, integration workflows, and key sanity checks. These notes reflect my background in full-chip layout and my transition from analog to top-level physical design environments.
