# DRC & LVS Strategy

Design Rule Checks (DRC) and Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) are the last gatekeepers before tape-in. Passing these cleanly is required for signoff, and layout engineers are often the first (and sometimes only) line of defense.

## Design Rule Checks (DRC)

Checks physical layout against foundry-defined constraints:
- **Spacing** (min distance between layers, vias, metals)
- **Width** (min/max metal width, poly, diffusion)
- **Enclosure** (e.g., via-to-metal, contact-to-poly)
- **Density** (metal fill, dummy shapes, coverage zones)
- **Antenna** (excessive gate area exposed during fabrication)

### Tools
- **Calibre DRC** (industry standard)
- **Pegasus** (faster signoff checks in some flows)

### PDE-Relevant DRC Challenges
- Fill-induced DRCs post-routing
- Straps violating width/spacing on thick metals
- PG overlaps near pad cells causing notch violations
- IO pad pitch violations after late ECOs

## LVS – Layout vs Schematic

Ensures that the netlist extracted from layout matches the design schematic:
- Verifies **connectivity**, **device sizes**, and **hierarchy integrity**
- Identifies **opens, shorts, missing connections**, or unintended merges

### Common LVS Mismatches
- **Extra shorts** from fill overlap or auto-routing
- **Missing connections** from incorrect pin shapes or orientation
- **Device mismatch** due to drawn W/L or incorrect diffusion

### PDE-Relevant LVS Scenarios
- Hierarchical LVS runs may miss errors at macro boundaries if pins aren’t clean
- Analog blocks require **custom pins and precise placement**
- LVS may pass locally but fail at top if net naming isn’t preserved

### Pro Tip

Always rerun DRC and LVS after:
- Routing changes
- PG net merges
- Fill insertion
- Late-stage ECOs

DRC and LVS failures at tape-in = delay + budget bleed. Catch it early, fix it clean, sleep at night.
